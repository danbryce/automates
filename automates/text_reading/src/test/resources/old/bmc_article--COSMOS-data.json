        "content": "Abstract Attention: Some of the information in this document is not factually correct and was only included to test the functionality of the alignment component of the Automates project developed at the UArizona. A lot of the text is based on work by Ng. et al, 2003. Background: An epidemic of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus has spread from the Guangdong province to the rest of China and to the world, with a puzzling contagion behavior. It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing eﬀective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Results: In this report, we show ﬁrst that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. Conclusion: We ﬁnd that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a ﬁrst milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the ﬁrst epidemic, or that were aﬀected simultaneously with the SARS suﬀered much more, with a very high percentage of persons aﬀected. We also ﬁnd regions where the data appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reﬂect an appropriate identiﬁcation of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, ﬁx limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

One approach is to use the values of a and b for all the diﬀerent scenarios before the parameters r, rP and a P are chosen to ﬁt the data. The parameters a and aP describe the removal from the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the individuals with infections the parameters a and aP characterize the identiﬁcation rate of potential cases; it is then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!).

        "content": "Transmissibility is measured in millimeters. For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions (e.g. the case of Hong Kong) and an initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons with current I = 15, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, transmissibility is set to 32 mm. But other times, τ = 450 kg, for example, when a = 3 and S(0) = 4.5 million. Currently, I is positive. For many deterministic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0 > 1. 1/a + 1/b = 11.83 The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the susceptibles S, that is rS(t)I(t), where r > 0 is a constant. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rP S(t)IP (t), where rP > 0 is a constant. The rate of removal of the people in class E to the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. The exposed class is measured in people. E = 30. The number of people in explosed class is equal to 35. A susceptible who catches the disease B ﬁrst will enter the class I P of infectives and then the Removed class RP , and rP is a coeﬃcient for calculating the rate of recovery. γ is the inverse of the mean recovery time, in days. i.e.: if γ =1/14 then the average infection will clear in 14 days. It+1 = It + βStIt − γIt A makes contact suﬃcient to transmit infection with rN others per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN )(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class",

Here we follow the deﬁnition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers’ attention that this deﬁnition of the class R is diﬀerent from those given in [7], [11] which do not include isolated infectives in the class R. The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usually only R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t) is the cumulative number of patients admitted to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations (see next section for the derivation of these diﬀerential equations): dS dt = −rS(t)I(t) dI dt = rS(t)I(t) − aI(t) dR dt = aI(t) dS dt = −rS(t)I(t) − rP S(t)IP (t) where r is the infection rate and a the removal rate of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propagation of the disease and can also be used as control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. The infection rate is measured at germs per second and ranges between 0.2 and 5.6 germs per second. Infection rate of 0.5 germs per second is considered low. When r is negative, it is time to celebrate. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow.",

An important descriptive parameter of virus A is the basic reproduction number, or R0, measured in microbes squared per year. This represents the average number of people who will be infected by any given infected person. When R0 is greater than 1, it means that a disease will grow. When the basic reproductive number is between 0.5 and 1, the danger is moderate. A higher R0 implies more rapid transmission and a more rapid growth of the epidemic. It is deﬁned as R0 = β/γ R0 is larger when the pathogen is more infectious people are infectious for longer periods of time the number susceptible people is higher. Right now, R0 = 10, but last month the basic reproductive number was 100 m2/year. A doubling time of 6 days and a recovery time of 14.0 days imply an R0 of 2.71",
