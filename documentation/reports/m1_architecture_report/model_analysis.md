## 5. Model Analysis 

Once we have lifted multiple scientific models from source code that
compete with each other to represent the same phenomena we will enter
the analysis phase. The two main goals of this phase will be to compare
model fitness and to augment existing models to improve them according
to one or more metrics, such as the amount of uncertainty in model
output/predictions, the computational cost of the model, and the cost of
data collection associated with the model.

### Function Network Structural Comparison 

The first step of comparative model analysis will be to compare the
computational structure of the two competing models. All of our
extracted models will be represented by networks, a graph structure with
the property that a subset of the nodes will be input nodes and a
different subset will be output nodes.

### Sensitivity Analysis

#### Output uncertainty estimation

#### Value of information measures
