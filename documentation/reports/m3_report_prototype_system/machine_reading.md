- evaluated options and decided on science-parse and grobid-quantities
- docker containers for science-parse and grobid-quantities
- created a new scala project using odin and components from eidos
- scala interfaces to science-parse and grobid-quantities
- developed grammars to extract variables and link them to grobid quantities and to natural language definitions
- collaborating with georgia-tech
- limitations of the current tools (e.g., no section normalization in science-parse, unicode in grobid-quantities, intervals are inconsistent)

- planning on extracting variable info from comments
- begin aligning
