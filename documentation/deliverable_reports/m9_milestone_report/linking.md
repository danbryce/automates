## Linking

### General Linking Problem

TODO: Clay

Include description of linking tasks as identified in graph

### Text and Equation Linking

The team is working to not only extract variables from equations, but also to link them to the in-text variables as well as the source code variables.  In order to evaluate the performance of the former, the team has begun creating an evaluation dataset. 
The specific task the team is looking to evaluate is linking the equation variables to their in-text definitions (ex. 1) and, when present, the associated units (ex. 2).

This effort will include the following steps:
- (in progress) collecting the documents to annotate: currently, the team is working on creating a set of heuristics to select the documents most suitable for the annotation exercise;
- (in progress) creating the annotation guidelines: the team is going through an iterative process of testing the guidelines on a small number of annotators and adjusting the guidelines based on the quality of elicited annotations, the level of agreement between the annotators, and the annotatorsâ€™ feedback;
- annotating the documents;
- calculating the inter-annotator agreement score as a measure of quality of the created dataset.

Once completed, the team will use the collected dataset to evaluate linking techniques.
