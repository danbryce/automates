## Program Analysis

In prior reporting periods, program analysis had focused on front end processing: lifting Fortran source code into a Python-based intermediate representation (IR) and translating a subset of the associated language features into the GrFN representation used for downstream analyses.  During the current reporting period, program analysis efforts focused on extending the translation to GrFN to encompass a wider variety of Fortran source-language features, including in particular loops and arrays.
