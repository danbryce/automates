## Program Analysis

In prior reporting periods, program analysis had focused on front end processing: lifting Fortran source code into a Python-based intermediate representation (IR) and translating a subset of the associated language features into the GrFN representation used for downstream analyses.  During the current reporting period, program analysis efforts focused on two objectives: (1) extending the translation to GrFN to encompass a wider variety of Fortran source-language features; and (2) applying and evaluating our tools on software for the SIR model for infectious diseases.  The extensions to GrFN involved formalizing the handling of loops and arrays and extending the GrFN generator to implement the translation to the extended GrFN representation.  Applying our tools to infectious disease models helped showcase the robustness of our tools as well as identify areas for improvement.
