## Program Analysis

In prior reporting periods, program analysis had focused on front end processing: lifting Fortran source code into a Python-based intermediate representation (IR) and translating a subset of the associated language features into the GrFN representation used for downstream analyses.  During the current reporting period, program analysis focused on extending the translation to GrFN to encompass a wider variety of Fortran source-language features, including in particular loops and arrays.  This effort involved two thrusts: first, formalizing and extending GrFN to encompass the behaviors of the language features; and second, extending the GrFN generator to implement the translation to the extended GrFN representation.
